I wrote 5 simple games as the Game Design homework.

All the codes are written in VC++/MFC. You need to download the *.exe and all the pictures if you want to run the *.exe.

I still don't understand how MFC works... I just know which sentence draw a window and which sentence draw pictures on the windows, but I don't understand how those MFC classes work.

However, I swear I won't use the VC++/MFC anymore! Qt is more practical to write a visual C++ program for me.
